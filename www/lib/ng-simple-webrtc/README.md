# ng-simple-webrtc

> AngularJS wrapper for SimpleWebRTC client from https://simplewebrtc.com/

[![NPM][npm-icon] ][npm-url]
[![Circle CI][circle-ci-icon] ][circle-ci-url]

AngularJS client for starting video / broadcasting to multiple peers via WebRTC, built
on top of the [SimpleWebRTC](https://simplewebrtc.com/) code.

This example wraps the calls to the WebRTC library into 2 simple Angular directives: a broadcaster
and a room watcher. A single broadcasted stream can be viewed by multiple watchers in a single room.

## Demo

To run the demo locally, clone the repo or install from NPM, then

    npm start

Open the broadcast page `localhost:3400/broadcast.html` and create a room. Open `localhost:3400/watch.html`
in a separate browser tab and enter the same room name. You should see the broadcasted picture.

## Install

    npm install ng-simple-webrtc --save

Include the script tags, at least Angular and SimpleWebRTC before this module

```html
<script src="node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/simplewebrtc/latest.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/ng-simple-webrtc/ng-simple-webrtc.js"></script>
```

Add `SimpleWebRTC` to the list of your application's module dependencies

```js
angular.module('WatchApp', ['SimpleWebRTC'])
    // adds custom directive <watch-room>
```

## Broadcast a room

Use directive `broadcaster` to connect to the local camera and broadcast the picture.
Communicate the room name, and see the status properties (`hasStream`, `isBroadcasting`) via
isolate scope's properties.

```html
<broadcaster
  has-stream="hasStream"
  room-name="roomName"
  mirror="true"
  muted="true"
  is-broadcasting="isBroadcasting"></broadcaster>
```

You can control camera mirror display by setting "true" or "false" value of the `mirror` attribute.

To connect to the camera and start a room, broadcast events `prepare` and `start`

```html
<div ng-controller="BroadcastAppController">
  <broadcaster
    has-stream="hasStream"
    room-name="roomName"
    is-broadcasting="isBroadcasting"></broadcaster>

  <button ng-click="prepare()" ng-disabled="hasStream">Prepare to broadcast</button>
  <div ng-show="hasStream">
    <input type="text" ng-model="roomName" placeholder="Enter a new room name" />
    <button ng-click="start()" ng-disabled="!roomName || broadcasting">Start room</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
```js
angular.module('BroadcastApp', ['SimpleWebRTC'])
  .controller('BroadcastAppController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.hasStream = false;
    $scope.roomName = '';
    $scope.isBroadcasting = '';
    $scope.prepare = function prepare() {
      $scope.$broadcast('prepare');
    };
    $scope.start = function start() {
      $scope.$broadcast('start');
    };
  });
```

See file [broadcast.html](broadcast.html) for the full demo

When local video starts, the directive broadcasts 'video-resolution' event with width and height
of the captured video stream.

## Watch a room

To join and watch a room (without broadcasting anything yourself) use `watch-room` directive.
You can pass the room name and see the status via isolate scope attributes

```html
<input type="text" ng-model="roomName" placeholder="Join room with name" />
<watch-room 
  room-name="roomName" 
  joined-room="joinedRoom" 
  muted="true"
  nick="myEmail"
  max-num-peers="maxAllowedWatchers"></watch-room>
```

`maxAllowedWatchers` property controls how many people can be in the room when joining,
default 10. If more than that, the watcher will leave the room, emitting a message `room-full`.

`nick` is an optional property sent to the remote group on disconnect.

You can start watching (join a room) and stop watching (leave a room) by broadcasting
an event

```html
<div ng-controller="WatchAppController">
  <input type="text" ng-model="roomName" placeholder="Join room with name" />
  <watch-room room-name="roomName" joined-room="joinedRoom"></watch-room>
  <button ng-click="joinRoom()">Join room</button>
  <button ng-click="leaveRoom()">Leave room</button>
</div>
```

```js
angular.module('WatchApp', ['SimpleWebRTC'])
  .controller('WatchAppController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.roomName = '';
    $scope.joinedRoom = false;
    $scope.joinRoom = function () {
      $scope.$broadcast('joinRoom');
    };
    $scope.leaveRoom = function () {
      $scope.$broadcast('leaveRoom');
    };
  });
```

See the included file [watch.html](watch.html) as an example

## Custom video list

You can supply an array to hold all videos and handle the layout by your self instead of appended by the library. 
You must provide an empty array to initialize it and pass it to the `video-list` attribute to `broadcaster` or `watch-room` directives (or both).

```html
  <watch-room room-name="roomName" joined-room="joinedRoom" video-list="videoList"></watch-room>
```

```js
angular.module('WatchApp', ['SimpleWebRTC'])
  .controller('WatchAppController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.roomName = '';
    $scope.joinedRoom = false;
    $scope.videoList = []; // initialize videoList variable to hold all videos coming to watch-room directive
    $scope.joinRoom = function () {
      $scope.$broadcast('joinRoom');
    };
    $scope.leaveRoom = function () {
      $scope.$broadcast('leaveRoom');
    };
  });
```

## Details

The `webrtc` object created by the `SimpleWebRTC` library is attached to the `$rootScope`.

To broadcast a message to all peers in the room via RTC data channel, use `messageAll` event.

```js
$scope.sendMessage = function sendMessage() {
  $scope.$broadcast('messageAll', {
    from: 'username',
    text: 'hi there'
  });
};
```

Each peer will receive the message via 'channelMessage' event. The event will have 2 arguments: `peer` and `message`.

```js
$scope.$on('channelMessage', function (event, peer, message) {
  console.log('message', message);
});
```

The `message` is automatically JSON stringified and parsed when sent.

If the page has global variable `peerConnectionConfig`, it will be added to the simple webrtc options
during creation. Useful for paid ICE/STUN/TURN services, 
see for example [xirsys.com](http://xirsys.com/simplewebrtc/) documentation.
